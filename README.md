# ðŸŽ¨ Dot Painting Generator 

This project is a little **dot painting generator** built using Python's `turtle` graphics library. Inspired by abstract pop-art styles (like Damien Hirst's dot paintings), it generates a grid of randomly colored dots to create a colorful digital artwork.


> ðŸ“¹ A short [**demo video**](demo.mp4) is also included in the repository.
